## Why This Project? (Core Pain Points & Use Cases)

### Who Is This For?
If any of the following describes your home theater setup, this launcher was built for you:
- **TCL Android TV / Google TV Users**: You own a TCL Smart TV and want an ultra-fast, bloatware-free launcher tailored specifically to TCL's native display and TV input framework (`com.tcl.tvinput`).
- **External Input Purists**: You rely almost entirely on external high-performance hardware, and your TV's built-in Smart TV OS is merely a "panel driver":
  - 🍏 **Apple TV 4K** — Primary platform for streaming, movies, and TV shows.
  - 🎮 **PlayStation 5 (PS5) / Xbox Series X / Nintendo Switch** — Next-gen 4K HDR gaming.
  - 📺 **Dedicated TV Boxes** (Chromecast with Google TV, NVIDIA Shield, Fire TV, etc.).
  - 💿 **4K UHD Blu-ray / DVD Players** or **AV Receivers (eARC)**.
- **Tired of Bloated & Ad-Heavy Stock Launchers**: The factory TCL launcher is slow to boot, clutters the screen with unwanted video recommendations, and consumes precious RAM and background CPU cycles.
- **Want a True "Instant-On" Display Experience**: When you power on the TV, it should act like a traditional monitor or high-end display—automatically switching to your favorite input (e.g., Apple TV) within seconds without you ever having to touch a remote.
- **Lightning-Fast Multi-Device Switching**: When switching between a gaming console (PS5) and a streaming box (Apple TV), you want instant switching at the press of a single remote number button (`1` / `2` / `3`), without navigating clunky input menus.

## Installation & Setup Guide

### Step 1: Build the APK

```bash
# Build Debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Or build ultra-optimized Release APK (~9.0 KB)
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Step 2: Enable ADB on Your TCL TV & Install
1. On your TCL TV, open System Settings -> "About" -> click "Build Number" 7 times to enable Developer Options.
2. In "Developer Options", enable "USB Debugging" or "Network Debugging".
3. Connect your computer to your TV over ADB:

```bash
# Connect to your TV's IP address
adb connect 192.168.1.xxx:5555

# Install the APK
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Step 3: Set as Default TV Launcher

```bash
# Set this app as the default Home launcher
adb shell cmd package set-home-activity com.lnu.tclhdmilauncher/.MainActivity
```
*Pressing the remote's "Home" button will now open this clean HDMI launcher.*

### Step 4: Disable the Bloated TCL Stock Launcher (Optional, Recommended)
To completely prevent the factory launcher from running or waking in the background:

```bash
# 1. Find TCL factory launcher package name
adb shell pm list packages | grep -i launcher

# 2. Disable the stock launcher (safe and reversible)
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 <tcl.launcher.package.name>
```

> [!TIP]
> **Completely Reversible:**  
> If you ever want to restore the factory TCL launcher, simply run:
> ```bash
> adb shell pm enable <tcl.launcher.package.name>
> adb shell cmd package clear-preferred-activities com.lnu.tclhdmilauncher
> ```

### Step 5: (Highly Recommended) Enable "Wake Guard & Home Button Mapper"

Enabling the Accessibility Service grants two system-level capabilities:
1. **Standby Wake Guard**: Guaranteed 100% return to this Launcher on sleep wake (preventing AV input / no signal).
2. **Button Mapper (Home Key Redirection)**: No matter which app you are in, pressing the remote **Home button** is intercepted to open this Launcher directly!

**How to enable:**
- In the Launcher top bar, click the "Wake Guard" button (`⚠️ Wake Guard: Off`) and select "Open Settings" (or manually go to TV Settings ➔ Device Preferences ➔ Accessibility).
- Toggle **"HDMI Launcher Wake & Home Button Mapper"** to ON.

### Step 6: (Troubleshooting) Fix Apple TV / HDMI-CEC Standby Wake Glitch (Double-Power-Key Bug)

#### Problem
When putting the TV into standby via Apple TV or other HDMI-CEC connected devices, certain TCL TVs (such as C715 / RTD2851 platforms) may briefly turn off the screen, only to turn right back on within 1 second and launch the TCL TV app, or appear not to turn off at all.

#### Root Cause (Logcat Analysis)
1. **Apple TV Dual CEC Standby Commands**:  
   Per HDMI-CEC specifications, when Apple TV goes to sleep, it sends two consecutive Standby frames within ~79ms (a broadcast frame `4F:36` followed by a unicast frame `40:36`).
2. **TCL Firmware Flaw**:  
   TCL's `TclPowerManagerService` dispatches a `com.tcl.voicestandby` broadcast for every standby command received.  
   The built-in `com.tcl.tv` package has a `VoicePowerBroadcastReceiver` that intercepts this broadcast and **simulates pressing the hardware power button (`keyCode 4000 -> 26 KEYCODE_POWER`)**.
3. **Double Power Key Injection Within 95ms**:  
   - **First Key Press**: The TV screen turns off and enters sleep mode (`interactive=false`).  
   - **Second Key Press** (~95ms later): Arrives while the device is sleeping, which **immediately wakes the TV back up** (and can even trigger Android's double-press power button camera gesture)!

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Do NOT disable the entire `com.tcl.tv` package!**  
> On TCL Android TVs, HDMI 1/2/3 passthrough playback and video rendering are hosted inside `com.tcl.tv.TVActivity`. Disabling the entire package will completely break HDMI video display.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why an In-App Software Watchdog / Sleep Debounce is Not Recommended:**  
> Attempting to detect this in an app and force sleep via `GLOBAL_ACTION_LOCK_SCREEN` or suppress wakeups with a debounce timer causes false positives due to overlapping `isInteractive` state transitions during normal boots and wakes—**preventing the Launcher from auto-starting reliably on legitimate power-ons**. Disabling the rogue component at the OS level is the only clean, side-effect-free solution.

#### The Permanent Solution: Disable the Rogue Key-Injection Component via ADB
Android allows disabling individual components within a package. Disabling **only the broadcast receiver that injects the duplicate power key** fixes the glitch completely without affecting HDMI passthrough playback:

```bash
# 1. Disable the rogue power broadcast receiver (HDMI video playback remains 100% intact)
adb shell pm disable com.tcl.tv/com.tcl.tv.receiver.VoicePowerBroadcastReceiver

# 2. (Optional) Disable the background key-injection service
adb shell pm disable com.tcl.tv/.service.GlobalKeyService

# 3. (Optional) Disable double-tap power camera gesture
adb shell settings put secure camera_double_tap_power_gesture_disabled 1
```

> [!TIP]
> **Reversible at any time:**  
> If you ever want to restore factory default behavior, simply run:  
> `adb shell pm enable com.tcl.tv/com.tcl.tv.receiver.VoicePowerBroadcastReceiver`  
> `adb shell pm enable com.tcl.tv/.service.GlobalKeyService`

```

**Architectural Principles:**
- `finishAndRemoveTask()` — Activity exits completely upon switching, freeing 100% memory.
- `excludeFromRecents="true"` — Prevents cluttering recent apps.
- `singleTask` — Avoids duplicate Activity stack creation.
- Non-blocking Handler retry — Built-in fault tolerance while system TV services initialize on cold boot.
